Terria Map
==========

# We will be deprecating our master branch (v7) of TerriaJS in early August 2021
What this means:
- The [Next branch of TerriaMap](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap/tree/next) will become our new main branch as this uses v8 of TerriaJS
- We will be actively monitoring our issues in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/issues/new)
