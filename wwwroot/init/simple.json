      "description": "As the proportion of wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) in an electrical grid extends into the 50-100% range a combination of additional long-distance high voltage transmission, demand management and local storage is required for stability. Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) constitutes 97% of electricity storage worldwide because of its low cost.<p>The <a href='http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global'>RE100 Group ANU</a> found about 530,000 potentially feasible PHES sites with storage potential of about 22 million Gigawatt-hours (GWh) by using geographic information system (GIS) analysis. This is about one hundred times greater than required to support a 100% global renewable electricity system. Brownfield sites (existing reservoirs, old mining sites) will be included in a future analysis.</p>This information has been developed by the 100% Renewable Energy group from the Research School of Electrical, Energy and Materials Engineering at the Australia National University.  http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au<p>Potential sites for off-river PHES are identified using GIS algorithms with defined search criteria. The surveyed latitude range is up to 60 degrees north and south. Each identified site comprises an upper and lower reservoir pair plus a hypothetical tunnel route between the reservoirs, and includes data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, head, slope, water volume, water area, rock volume, dam wall length, water/rock ratio, energy storage potential and approximate relative cost (categories A-E).</p><p>Wall heights are adjusted for each reservoir in a pair to yield equal water volumes to achieve the targeted energy storage. Energy (= head * usable volume * g * efficiency) and storage-length combinations are provided in Table 1. The approximate number of people that a reservoirs could service for a 100% renewable electricity grid is listed in the third line.</p><style>  table, th, td {    border: 1px solid black;    padding: 5px;    text-align: center;  }</style><center><table>  <tr>   <th>Energy</th> <th>Duration</th> <th>Millions of people</th> </tr> <tr>   <th>2 GWh</th> <td>6 hours</td> <td>0.1</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>5 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>15 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.75</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>50 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>2.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>150 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>7.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>500 GWh</th> <td>168 hours</td> <td>25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>1500 GWh</th> <td>504 hours</td> <td>75</td>   </tr> </table></center><p>Virtually all upper reservoirs are away from rivers, and none intrude on protected area or urban areas listed in the databases that we use below.

      "description": "As the proportion of wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) in an electrical grid extends into the 50-100% range a combination of additional long-distance high voltage transmission, demand management and local storage is required for stability. Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) constitutes 97% of electricity storage worldwide because of its low cost.<p>The <a href='http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global'>RE100 Group ANU</a> found about 530,000 potentially feasible PHES sites with storage potential of about 22 million Gigawatt-hours (GWh) by using geographic information system (GIS) analysis. This is about one hundred times greater than required to support a 100% global renewable electricity system. Brownfield sites (existing reservoirs, old mining sites) will be included in a future analysis.</p>This information has been developed by the 100% Renewable Energy group from the Research School of Electrical, Energy and Materials Engineering at the Australia National University.  http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au<p>Potential sites for off-river PHES are identified using GIS algorithms with defined search criteria. The surveyed latitude range is up to 60 degrees north and south. Each identified site comprises an upper and lower reservoir pair plus a hypothetical tunnel route between the reservoirs, and includes data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, head, slope, water volume, water area, rock volume, dam wall length, water/rock ratio, energy storage potential and approximate relative cost (categories A-E).</p><p>Wall heights are adjusted for each reservoir in a pair to yield equal water volumes to achieve the targeted energy storage. Energy (= head * usable volume * g * efficiency) and storage-length combinations are provided in Table 1. The approximate number of people that a reservoirs could service for a 100% renewable electricity grid is listed in the third line.</p><style>  table, th, td {    border: 1px solid black;    padding: 5px;    text-align: center;  }</style><center><table>  <tr>   <th>Energy</th> <th>Duration</th> <th>Millions of people</th> </tr> <tr>   <th>2 GWh</th> <td>6 hours</td> <td>0.1</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>5 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>15 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.75</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>50 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>2.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>150 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>7.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>500 GWh</th> <td>168 hours</td> <td>25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>1500 GWh</th> <td>504 hours</td> <td>75</td>   </tr> </table></center><p>Virtually all upper reservoirs are away from rivers, and none intrude on protected area or urban areas listed in the databases that we use below.

          "description": "As the proportion of wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) in an electrical grid extends into the 50-100% range a combination of additional long-distance high voltage transmission, demand management and local storage is required for stability. Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) constitutes 97% of electricity storage worldwide because of its low cost.<p>The <a href='http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global'>RE100 Group ANU</a> found about 530,000 potentially feasible PHES sites with storage potential of about 22 million Gigawatt-hours (GWh) by using geographic information system (GIS) analysis. This is about one hundred times greater than required to support a 100% global renewable electricity system. Brownfield sites (existing reservoirs, old mining sites) will be included in a future analysis.</p>This information has been developed by the 100% Renewable Energy group from the Research School of Electrical, Energy and Materials Engineering at the Australia National University.  http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au<p>Potential sites for off-river PHES are identified using GIS algorithms with defined search criteria. The surveyed latitude range is up to 60 degrees north and south. Each identified site comprises an upper and lower reservoir pair plus a hypothetical tunnel route between the reservoirs, and includes data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, head, slope, water volume, water area, rock volume, dam wall length, water/rock ratio, energy storage potential and approximate relative cost (categories A-E).</p><p>Wall heights are adjusted for each reservoir in a pair to yield equal water volumes to achieve the targeted energy storage. Energy (= head * usable volume * g * efficiency) and storage-length combinations are provided in Table 1. The approximate number of people that a reservoirs could service for a 100% renewable electricity grid is listed in the third line.</p><style>  table, th, td {    border: 1px solid black;    padding: 5px;    text-align: center;  }</style><center><table>  <tr>   <th>Energy</th> <th>Duration</th> <th>Millions of people</th> </tr> <tr>   <th>2 GWh</th> <td>6 hours</td> <td>0.1</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>5 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>15 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.75</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>50 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>2.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>150 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>7.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>500 GWh</th> <td>168 hours</td> <td>25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>1500 GWh</th> <td>504 hours</td> <td>75</td>   </tr> </table></center><p>Virtually all upper reservoirs are away from rivers, and none intrude on protected area or urban areas listed in the databases that we use below.

          "description": "As the proportion of wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) in an electrical grid extends into the 50-100% range a combination of additional long-distance high voltage transmission, demand management and local storage is required for stability. Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) constitutes 97% of electricity storage worldwide because of its low cost.<p>The <a href='http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global'>RE100 Group ANU</a> found about 530,000 potentially feasible PHES sites with storage potential of about 22 million Gigawatt-hours (GWh) by using geographic information system (GIS) analysis. This is about one hundred times greater than required to support a 100% global renewable electricity system. Brownfield sites (existing reservoirs, old mining sites) will be included in a future analysis.</p>This information has been developed by the 100% Renewable Energy group from the Research School of Electrical, Energy and Materials Engineering at the Australia National University.  http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au<p>Potential sites for off-river PHES are identified using GIS algorithms with defined search criteria. The surveyed latitude range is up to 60 degrees north and south. Each identified site comprises an upper and lower reservoir pair plus a hypothetical tunnel route between the reservoirs, and includes data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, head, slope, water volume, water area, rock volume, dam wall length, water/rock ratio, energy storage potential and approximate relative cost (categories A-E).</p><p>Wall heights are adjusted for each reservoir in a pair to yield equal water volumes to achieve the targeted energy storage. Energy (= head * usable volume * g * efficiency) and storage-length combinations are provided in Table 1. The approximate number of people that a reservoirs could service for a 100% renewable electricity grid is listed in the third line.</p><style>  table, th, td {    border: 1px solid black;    padding: 5px;    text-align: center;  }</style><center><table>  <tr>   <th>Energy</th> <th>Duration</th> <th>Millions of people</th> </tr> <tr>   <th>2 GWh</th> <td>6 hours</td> <td>0.1</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>5 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>15 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.75</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>50 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>2.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>150 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>7.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>500 GWh</th> <td>168 hours</td> <td>25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>1500 GWh</th> <td>504 hours</td> <td>75</td>   </tr> </table></center><p>Virtually all upper reservoirs are away from rivers, and none intrude on protected area or urban areas listed in the databases that we use below.

Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) constitutes 97% of electricity storage worldwide because of its low cost.<p>The <a href='http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global'>RE100 Group ANU</a> found about 530,000 potentially feasible PHES sites with storage potential of about 22 million Gigawatt-hours (GWh) by using geographic information system (GIS) analysis. This is about one hundred times greater than required to support a 100% global renewable electricity system. Brownfield sites (existing reservoirs, old mining sites) will be included in a future analysis.</p>This information has been developed by the 100% Renewable Energy group from the Research School of Electrical, Energy and Materials Engineering at the Australia National University.  http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au<p>Potential sites for off-river PHES are identified using GIS algorithms with defined search criteria. The surveyed latitude range is up to 60 degrees north and south. Each identified site comprises an upper and lower reservoir pair plus a hypothetical tunnel route between the reservoirs, and includes data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, head, slope, water volume, water area, rock volume, dam wall length, water/rock ratio, energy storage potential and approximate relative cost (categories A-E).</p><p>Wall heights are adjusted for each reservoir in a pair to yield equal water volumes to achieve the targeted energy storage. Energy (= head * usable volume * g * efficiency) and storage-length combinations are provided in Table 1. The approximate number of people that a reservoirs could service for a 100% renewable electricity grid is listed in the third line.</p><style>  table, th, td {    border: 1px solid black;    padding: 5px;    text-align: center;  }</style><center><table>  <tr>   <th>Energy</th> <th>Duration</th> <th>Millions of people</th> </tr> <tr>   <th>2 GWh</th> <td>6 hours</td> <td>0.1</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>5 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>15 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.75</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>50 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>2.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>150 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>7.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>500 GWh</th> <td>168 hours</td> <td>25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>1500 GWh</th> <td>504 hours</td> <td>75</td>   </tr> </table></center><p>Virtually all upper reservoirs are away from rivers, and none intrude on protected area or urban areas listed in the databases that we use below.

Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) constitutes 97% of electricity storage worldwide because of its low cost.<p>The <a href='http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global'>RE100 Group ANU</a> found about 530,000 potentially feasible PHES sites with storage potential of about 22 million Gigawatt-hours (GWh) by using geographic information system (GIS) analysis. This is about one hundred times greater than required to support a 100% global renewable electricity system. Brownfield sites (existing reservoirs, old mining sites) will be included in a future analysis.</p>This information has been developed by the 100% Renewable Energy group from the Research School of Electrical, Energy and Materials Engineering at the Australia National University.  http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au<p>Potential sites for off-river PHES are identified using GIS algorithms with defined search criteria. The surveyed latitude range is up to 60 degrees north and south. Each identified site comprises an upper and lower reservoir pair plus a hypothetical tunnel route between the reservoirs, and includes data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, head, slope, water volume, water area, rock volume, dam wall length, water/rock ratio, energy storage potential and approximate relative cost (categories A-E).</p><p>Wall heights are adjusted for each reservoir in a pair to yield equal water volumes to achieve the targeted energy storage. Energy (= head * usable volume * g * efficiency) and storage-length combinations are provided in Table 1. The approximate number of people that a reservoirs could service for a 100% renewable electricity grid is listed in the third line.</p><style>  table, th, td {    border: 1px solid black;    padding: 5px;    text-align: center;  }</style><center><table>  <tr>   <th>Energy</th> <th>Duration</th> <th>Millions of people</th> </tr> <tr>   <th>2 GWh</th> <td>6 hours</td> <td>0.1</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>5 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>15 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.75</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>50 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>2.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>150 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>7.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>500 GWh</th> <td>168 hours</td> <td>25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>1500 GWh</th> <td>504 hours</td> <td>75</td>   </tr> </table></center><p>Virtually all upper reservoirs are away from rivers, and none intrude on protected area or urban areas listed in the databases that we use below.

Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) constitutes 97% of electricity storage worldwide because of its low cost.<p>The <a href='http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global'>RE100 Group ANU</a> found about 530,000 potentially feasible PHES sites with storage potential of about 22 million Gigawatt-hours (GWh) by using geographic information system (GIS) analysis. This is about one hundred times greater than required to support a 100% global renewable electricity system. Brownfield sites (existing reservoirs, old mining sites) will be included in a future analysis.</p>This information has been developed by the 100% Renewable Energy group from the Research School of Electrical, Energy and Materials Engineering at the Australia National University.  http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au<p>Potential sites for off-river PHES are identified using GIS algorithms with defined search criteria. The surveyed latitude range is up to 60 degrees north and south. Each identified site comprises an upper and lower reservoir pair plus a hypothetical tunnel route between the reservoirs, and includes data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, head, slope, water volume, water area, rock volume, dam wall length, water/rock ratio, energy storage potential and approximate relative cost (categories A-E).</p><p>Wall heights are adjusted for each reservoir in a pair to yield equal water volumes to achieve the targeted energy storage.

          "description": "As the proportion of wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) in an electrical grid extends into the 50-100% range a combination of additional long-distance high voltage transmission, demand management and local storage is required for stability. Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) constitutes 97% of electricity storage worldwide because of its low cost.<p>The <a href='http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global'>RE100 Group ANU</a> found about 530,000 potentially feasible PHES sites with storage potential of about 22 million Gigawatt-hours (GWh) by using geographic information system (GIS) analysis. This is about one hundred times greater than required to support a 100% global renewable electricity system. Brownfield sites (existing reservoirs, old mining sites) will be included in a future analysis.</p>This information has been developed by the 100% Renewable Energy group from the Research School of Electrical, Energy and Materials Engineering at the Australia National University.  http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au<p>Potential sites for off-river PHES are identified using GIS algorithms with defined search criteria. The surveyed latitude range is up to 60 degrees north and south. Each identified site comprises an upper and lower reservoir pair plus a hypothetical tunnel route between the reservoirs, and includes data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, head, slope, water volume, water area, rock volume, dam wall length, water/rock ratio, energy storage potential and approximate relative cost (categories A-E).</p><p>Wall heights are adjusted for each reservoir in a pair to yield equal water volumes to achieve the targeted energy storage. Energy (= head * usable volume * g * efficiency) and storage-length combinations are provided in Table 1. The approximate number of people that a reservoirs could service for a 100% renewable electricity grid is listed in the third line.</p><style>  table, th, td {    border: 1px solid black;    padding: 5px;    text-align: center;  }</style><center><table>  <tr>   <th>Energy</th> <th>Duration</th> <th>Millions of people</th> </tr> <tr>   <th>2 GWh</th> <td>6 hours</td> <td>0.1</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>5 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>15 GWh</th> <td>18 hours</td> <td>0.75</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>50 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>2.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>150 GWh</th> <td>50 hours</td> <td>7.5</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>500 GWh</th> <td>168 hours</td> <td>25</td>   </tr>  <tr>    <th>1500 GWh</th> <td>504 hours</td> <td>75</td>   </tr> </table></center><p>Virtually all upper reservoirs are away from rivers, and none intrude on protected area or urban areas listed in the databases that we use below.

              "description": "\nSolar and wind play major roles in decarbonising the energy system. But where are the best sites?\n\nIn our high-resolution heat maps, an indicative cost of electricity (in AUD/MWh) is calculated for each pixel (1km x 1km for solar and 250m x 250m for wind), comprising the cost of energy from a solar/wind farm PLUS an associated powerline connecting the solar/wind farm to the existing and planned high voltage transmission network.\n\nAccess to transmission is currently the largest constraint for solar/wind farms. Heat maps identify the potential of all prospective areas close to the transmission network and are much more useful than solar and wind data alone.\n\nOur heat maps provide detailed qualitative and quantitative information about prospective places for solar and wind farms. They balance knowledge between developers and landholders. They empower landholders and local Government to identify prospective area and facilitate collective bargaining with developers.\n\nThe maps use colours to show the lowest indicative costs for wind or solar. The example below shows the area around Tamworth for the low-cost, overhead transmission line scenario for solar farms. The lowest indicative cost is in red, pink shows the second lowest costs, and the unsuitable areas within urban areas and the surrounding National Parks are shown in green.\n",
